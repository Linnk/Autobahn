h1. Autobahn

h2. A simple ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for PHP5

Autobahn is a bit far from the simple ORM would like, however, is already a very good database abstraction. I will be focused on developing and refining this layer of the system, which provides:

- Manager of connections to the database
- Magic Methods for access to data
- SQL Query Builder
- Extend the support database

Achieving these goals, the next step is to create a model of a complete object-oriented database (ORM). I do not want to imitate existing projects as Propel (an excellent ORM), more than that, I would like an ORM simple, easy to implement for small jobs, and so fast and efficient as its simplicity.

h3. KISS - «Keep It Short and Simple»

You need declare a php class named "DB_CONFIG" with a property (an array) named as you want (I recommend "default", because Autobahn is which going to looking for in first place) with the values of the "driver", "host", "user", "password" and "database" for your connection . You can put this class in other file (it's recommend too) and set the constant with the path of this. After that, is all automagic:

<pre><code>require('lib/autobahn.php');
define('AUTOBAHN_DB_CONFIG', AUTOBAHN_ROOT.'db_config.php');

$library = Autobahn::getConnection('default'); // "default" is the name of your connection.

//	Classic SQL
$authors = $library->query('SELECT Author.id, Author.firstname FROM authors Author');	

//	Show stats of the query
$library->showLogs();

</code></pre>

h3. Classic SQL

The "query" function is more than just a mask for the database manager. It's actually a method that executes the query, make statistics of the process and the result is post-processed to deliver a structured array of the query. Example:

<pre><code>//	Classic SQL
$authors = $library->query('SELECT Author.*, Book.* FROM authors Author, books Book WHERE Book.author_id = Author.id');

print_r($authors); 

/* The result is:
Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [Author] => Array
                (
                    [id] => 1
                    [firstname] => John
                    [lastname] => Romero
                )

            [Book] => Array
                (
                    [id] => 2
                    [author_id] => 1
                    [title] => Frameworks for languages
                )

        )
	[1] => Array ...
	[2] => Array ...
	[n] => Array ...
)
*/
</code></pre>

h3. Magic methods: Find, Insert, Update and Delete

This magic methods provides an easy and intuitive way to build the SQL query for the database selected. Probably you'll still have to do complicated queries, but now most everyday queries are easy to invoke:

<pre><code>//	Find
$book 			= $library->findBooksById(1);
$books 			= $library->findAllBooks();
$favorite_books = $library->findAllBooksById(1,2,3,4,5);

//	Insert
$newBook = array('id' => null, 'author_id' => 12, 'title' => 'Frameworks for PHP');
$library->insertBooks($newBook);

//	Update
$values = array('title' => 'Frameworks for PHP 5', 'description' => '...');
$conditions = array('id' => 10);
$library->updateBooks($values, $conditions);

//	Delete
$library->deleteBooksById(10,11,12);
</code></pre>

h3. Logs

The logs are used to analyze the efficiency of requests made. Each query executed from autobahn is stored in the log file with statistics by default:

<pre><code>require('lib/autobahn.php');

$library = Autobahn::getConnection('default');
$library->debug = true;

// Queries...

//	Show stats of all queries :)
$library->showLogs();
</code></pre>

h3. There are many things to do

Criticism and comments about it are welcome.
